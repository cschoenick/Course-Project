Description: Quickflip is intended to be a flashcard app similar to Quizlet. I hope to implement features that allow users to write multiple flashcards with terms and definitions. Given that more and more of Quizlet's features are becoming paid only, I felt that it would be a great exericse to not only learn Java but also implement something that I can use in my own life. This app should be able to help mostly students study course materials and prepare for any exams or quizzes; this app would be particularly helpful for learning new terms, vocabulary, or definitions. 

Plan/Effort: To begin, I intend on implementing the code to allow users to add terms and definitions to the flashcards, which I anticipate to be the easiest to accomplish. After this step, I would need to design and create a graphically user interface; I would like to design something similar to Quizlet that is user friendly and visually appealing. I anticipate this step to be the most difficult to accomplish and thus I intend to focus most of my efforts on learning JavaFX and imeplementing my graphical user interface.
